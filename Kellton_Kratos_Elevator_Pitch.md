# Kellton Kratos - 5 Slide Pitch Deck

---

## SLIDE 1: The Problem

**Title:** The AI Coding Tool Gap

**Visual:** Split screen: Left shows "Current Tools" (single brain icon), Right shows "Enterprise Needs" (multiple specialist icons)

### Key Points:
- ❌ **Single-agent limitations** — One AI can't master security, performance, AND architecture
- ❌ **Cloud-only tools** — Claude Code & Copilot don't meet enterprise compliance
- ❌ **No SDLC coverage** — Existing tools only help with coding, not full lifecycle
- ❌ **Tool fragmentation** — Teams juggle 5+ AI tools with zero integration

### Bottom Line:
> *"Enterprises need more than a coding assistant — they need an AI development team."*

## SLIDE 2: The Solution

**Title:** Kellton Kratos — 22 AI Agents. One Platform.

**Visual:** Agent ecosystem diagram showing SDLC phases

### Key Points:

| Phase | AI Agents |
|-------|-----------|
| **Planning** | Requirements Analyst, Business Panel, Deep Research |
| **Design** | System Architect, Backend Architect, Frontend Architect |
| **Development** | Python Expert, Refactoring Expert |
| **Testing** | Quality Engineer, Security Engineer, Performance Engineer |
