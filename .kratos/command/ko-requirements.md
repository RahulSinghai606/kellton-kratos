agent: requirements-analyst
---
Analyze the provided requirements document or project description. Extract and generate:

1. **Epics** - High-level features or capabilities
2. **User Stories** - Detailed requirements in "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable conditions for each story
4. **Technical Requirements** - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
5. **Dependencies** - Inter-story and external dependencies

Use Sequential MCP for systematic breakdown and Serena for code context when analyzing existing codebases.

Output structured requirements that can be imported into project management tools.
