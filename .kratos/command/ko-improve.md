Improve code quality for the specified files or directories:

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Detect technical debt
   - Find duplicate code
   - Measure complexity metrics

2. **Improvement Plan**:
   - Prioritize improvements by impact
   - Identify safe refactoring opportunities
   - Plan incremental changes

3. **Refactoring**:
   - Apply SOLID principles
   - Extract methods/classes
   - Simplify conditionals
   - Improve naming
   - Add type annotations

4. **Verification**:
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Verify no behavior changes
   - Check performance impact

Use Morphllm for pattern-based bulk transformations when applicable.
